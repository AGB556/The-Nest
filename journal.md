## Log 1: Idea Generation

I started this project by defining my goals and generating some ideas to start the CAD off of.

Goals:
 - Store 5 Spools of filament
 - sealed environment
 - active heating w/custom PCB to sense temperature/humidity
 - purpose built for HYDRA (hence the 5 spools)

Bonus: Add in an AMS type system as well, or at least an option to add it on later.

One option is to have one sealed system with active temperature control and heating for filament drying. This has many pros and cons, pros being the simplicity behind the idea and the fact that it is relatively simple to build. However, some cons are the fact that the system has to cool 5 spools at once, which not only requires more energy, but could waste energy if some of the spools are already dry and ready to go. One could also turn this into a MMU type system.

Another option is to seperate the filament drybox system into its own seperate but connected chamber, which would cut down on the energy and effort needed to dry the filament, while still having the capability to hold 5 spools. I could also add a MMU type system to the non drybox part as well. 

After deliberating, I will be going to explore the second option as it seems more viable as an option. I have not decided whether or not I will try to add an MMU system yet, but I am currently leaning towards not going for it as Hydra already has the capability to use 5 different filaments. It is still on the table for now though. 

Time Spent: 1 Hour
